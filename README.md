# sort
My program takes input from standard input, sorts the data and dumps the sorted data out to standard output.  The input will have the format of: b10371d9. Record Number: 00000000.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz x . Each record is 64 bytes long and the first 8 characters are the key.  The program sorts the data by the first 8 digits. The command in the command line will look like this: Sortmp 2 &lt;unsorted.txt >sorted.txt. In this case, my program will create 2 threads to do the job. Both threads will divide the work equally. If you give 50, then 50 threads will do the work, so on...
